# Identity-aware Cattle Identification and Tracking Demo

This notebook demonstrates the core components of our identity-aware
tracking framework for long-term cattle monitoring.

The demo is derived from the methods described in our paper and focuses on:
- Individual cow identification from a single image
- Short video-based identity-aware tracking

The goal is to provide an accessible and reproducible entry point for
researchers and practitioners interested in digital livestock monitoring.
