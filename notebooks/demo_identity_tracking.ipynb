# Identity-aware Cattle Identification and Tracking Demo

This notebook provides a lightweight demonstration of the core components
of our identity-aware tracking framework for long-term cattle monitoring.

The demo is derived from the methods described in our paper and focuses on:
- Individual cow identification from a single image
- Identity-aware inference on a short video sequence

The objective is to offer an accessible and reproducible entry point for
researchers and practitioners interested in computer vision–based livestock
monitoring, without requiring the full experimental pipeline.
